  <h2>SPECIALIEZED</h2>
  The company was founded in 1974 by Mike Sinyard,[2] a cycling enthusiast who sold his Volkswagen Bus for $1,500 to fund a cycle tour of Europe, where he bought handlebars and stems made by Cinelli to take back to the US.[3][4][5] Sinyard started out importing Italian bike components that were difficult to find in the United States,[2] but the company began to produce its own bike parts by 1976, starting with the Specialized Touring Tire.[4] In 1981, the company introduced its first two bikes, the Sequoia, a sport-touring design and the Allez, a road bike.[6] Specialized also introduced the first major production mountain bike in the world, the Stumpjumper, in 1981. Like the Sequoia and Allez, the Stumpjumper was designed by Tim Neenan and based on an early Tom Ritchey design. Specialized continues to produce bikes under the Stumpjumper name, including both hardtail and full-suspension models.[7] An original Stumpjumper is displayed in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.[4][8] In 1989, Specialized introduced the Epic, the world's second mass-production carbon fibre mountain bike.[6]</p>
